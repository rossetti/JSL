    Reading requires:
     - iterating forward through each row until end of rows
     - need a row or record abstraction
     - convenience methods for getting arrays of rows when columns all have same type
     - convenience methods for getting arrays of column values
     - convenience methods for getting matrix of row/column values when data is all same type
     - probably need a Cell abstraction, intersection of row and column
